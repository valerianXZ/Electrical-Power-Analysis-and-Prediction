# Time Series Forecasting with LSTM for Household Power Consumption

This repository contains code for time series forecasting of household power consumption data using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network built with TensorFlow/Keras.

## Dataset
Hebrail, G. & Berard, A. (2006). Individual Household Electric Power Consumption [Dataset]. UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://doi.org/10.24432/C58K54.

The dataset used is the "Household Power Consumption" dataset, which contains measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years.

## Project Overview

This project aims to:

* Preprocess and prepare time series data for LSTM modeling.
* Build and train a bidirectional LSTM model for forecasting `Global_active_power`.
* Evaluate the model's performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and RÂ² score.
* Visualize training and validation loss curves.
* Demonstrate techniques like early stopping and inverse scaling.

## Files
